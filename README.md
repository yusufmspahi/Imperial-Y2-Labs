# Thermal & Electrical Waves

> Based on: `Thermal and Electrical Waves.pdf`

### Overview  
This 8-session experiment explores wave propagation in two very different media and timescales:

- **Thermal Waves** — temperature oscillations in a solid metal cylinder on a timescale of seconds  
- **Electrical Waves** — voltage oscillations along a lumped transmission line on microsecond timescales  

Despite their differences, both systems are governed by analogous mathematical descriptions of wave behaviour.

### Part 1 — Thermal Waves  
You will:

- Drive periodic temperature oscillations via a **Peltier heat pump**  
- Measure propagation with embedded **thermistors**  
- Analyse **attenuation**, **phase lag**, and **dispersion**  
- Extract the **thermal diffusivity** of brass (and optionally aluminium or steel)

Core physics: the **heat diffusion equation**, Fourier analysis, and exponential attenuation.

### Part 2 — Electrical Waves  
You will:

- Use a **lumped LC transmission line**  
- Investigate **characteristic impedance**, **phase velocity**, **group velocity**  
- Explore **reflection**, **impedance matching**, and **standing waves**

Core physics: wave equation analogies, transmission line theory, and frequency-dependent propagation.

### Part 3 — Extensions  
Two sessions dedicated to open exploration:  
change the waveform, study non-sinusoidal propagation, test different materials, or analyse higher harmonics.

# Radioactivity

> Based on: `Radioactivity.pdf`

### Overview  
This experiment introduces ionising radiation, radioactive decay processes, and the use of silicon detectors for particle measurement. The main sources are:

- **Strontium-90 (β emitter)**
- **Americium-241 (α + γ emitter; only γ escapes the sealed mount)**

### Experimental System  
You will work with:

- A **silicon detector** producing signals from ionisation tracks  
- A built-in amplifier and threshold system  
- **Counter/timer** and **data acquisition software**  
- Adjustable source–detector distances and lead absorbers

### Objectives  
You will:

- Characterise random decay processes  
- Record and analyse **count rate distributions**  
- Study **absorption**, **energy spectra**, and **areal density**  
- Distinguish β vs γ interactions  
- Perform statistical analysis, including Poisson uncertainties and error propagation

This experiment heavily emphasises **meaningful uncertainty analysis** and careful data handling.

# Interferometry

> Based on: `Interferometry.pdf`

### Overview  
In this 4-week experiment, you build, align, and operate a **Michelson interferometer**, eventually using it as a **Fourier Transform spectrometer**.

You will work with:

- A **green laser**
- **White and blue LEDs**
- A **mercury discharge lamp**
- A **high-precision translation stage**
- Optical components (mirrors, lenses, beamsplitter cube, photodetectors)

### Key Topics  
- Alignment of a Michelson interferometer  
- **Haidinger fringes**, **circular fringes**, and **plane-wave fringes**  
- Coherence length, path-difference scanning, fringe visibility  
- Generating and analysing **interferograms**  
- Using interferograms to determine **spectral composition**  
- Correcting systematic errors with a monochromatic reference

### Higher-Level Skills  
You will also write custom scripts for:

- Simulating interferograms  
- Fourier transforming measured data  
- Comparing real data with theoretical predictions  
- Understanding the resolution–scan-length tradeoff  

This experiment gives a deep introduction to methods used in modern spectroscopy (including LIGO-style interferometry concepts).

# Assessment & Skills

Across all experiments, you are expected to:

- Keep a clear, real-time **lab notebook**  
- Justify experimental design choices  
- Propagate and interpret uncertainties  
- Present data clearly (graphs, error bars, fits)  
- Communicate concisely in reports or presentations  
- Reflect on your experimental process  
- Work effectively with peers and demonstrators

Assessment typically includes:

- Weekly **lab book sign-off**  
- A **presentation** (Waves experiment)
- A **two-page report** (Radioactivity)  
- A **four-page report** (Interferometry)  
- **Reflective logs**
